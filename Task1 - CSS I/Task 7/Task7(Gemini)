## Online Fonts and Favicons

### Online Fonts
Online fonts are fonts that are hosted on external servers and can be accessed and used on websites without having to download and install them locally. This offers several advantages, including:

* **Cross-platform compatibility:** Online fonts are accessible on various devices and operating systems.
* **Consistent appearance:** Users can expect a consistent font rendering across different browsers.
* **Easy updates:** New font versions or styles can be easily updated without requiring changes to the website's code.

### Using Google Fonts

Google Fonts is a popular service that provides a vast library of free fonts. To use Google Fonts in an HTML document, follow these steps:

1. **Choose Fonts:** Visit the Google Fonts website (fonts.google.com) and select the desired fonts.
2. **Generate Code:** Click the "Select" button next to each font, then click the "View code" button at the top.
3. **Copy and Paste:** Copy the generated HTML code and paste it into the `<head>` section of your HTML document.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,700">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `Roboto` font family is included in the `<head>` section using the Google Fonts CDN link.

### Favicons
A favicon is a small image that appears in the browser's tab or address bar, representing your website. It helps users identify your site among others and can improve brand recognition.

To add a favicon to your website, create a small square image (typically 16x16 or 32x32 pixels) in a `.ico` format. Then, include the following code in the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico">
```

Replace "favicon.ico" with the actual filename of your favicon.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="images/my-favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>
    </body>
</html>
```

By using online fonts and adding a favicon, you can enhance the visual appeal and professionalism of your website.
