## CSS Selectors: Targeting Elements

**CSS selectors** are used to specify which HTML elements should be affected by CSS styles. They act as a way to identify and address specific elements within a web page.

### Types of CSS Selectors

1. **Element Selector:** Targets elements based on their HTML tag name.
   - Example: `h1` targets all `<h1>` elements.

2. **Class Selector:** Targets elements that have a specific class attribute.
   - Example: `.special` targets all elements with the class attribute "special".

3. **ID Selector:** Targets a single element with a unique ID attribute.
   - Example: `#myElement` targets the element with the ID "myElement".

4. **Attribute Selector:** Targets elements based on their attributes.
   - Example: `[href]` targets all elements with an `href` attribute.

5. **Pseudo-class Selector:** Targets elements based on their state or condition.
   - Example: `:hover` targets an element when the mouse hovers over it.

### Example HTML Document with Various Selectors

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CSS Selectors</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">This is a paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com" id="myLink">Link</a>
    <div class="special">Special div</div>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Enter text">
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS Rules for Each Selector

```css
/* Element selector */
h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 36px;
}

/* Class selector */
.paragraph {
    font-size: 18px;
    color: blue;
}

/* ID selector */
#myLink {
    color: green;
    text-decoration: none;
}

/* Attribute selector */
[placeholder] {
    border: 1px solid black;
}

/* Pseudo-class selector */
a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

### How the Selectors Target Different Elements

* **Element selector (`h1`)**: Targets the `<h1>` element, changing its color and font size.
* **Class selector (`.paragraph`)**: Targets the element with the class "paragraph", changing its font size and color.
* **ID selector (`#myLink`)**: Targets the element with the ID "myLink", changing its color and removing the underline.
* **Attribute selector (`[placeholder]`)**: Targets the input element with the `placeholder` attribute, adding a border.
* **Pseudo-class selector (`a:hover`)**: Targets the `a` element when the mouse hovers over it, adding an underline.

By using these selectors, you can precisely target and style specific elements within your HTML document, creating a customized and visually appealing web page.
