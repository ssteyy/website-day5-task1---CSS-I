## CSS Basics: A Beginner's Guide

### What is CSS?
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a programming language used to style HTML elements. It controls the appearance of a web page, including colors, fonts, layout, and more. Think of CSS as the makeup for your website, allowing you to enhance its visual appeal and user experience.

### The Role of CSS in Web Development
CSS plays a crucial role in web development for several reasons:

* **Separation of Concerns:** CSS allows you to separate the structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) of a web page. This makes your code more organized, maintainable, and easier to understand.
* **Consistent Styling:** CSS enables you to apply consistent styles across multiple pages of a website, ensuring a uniform look and feel.
* **Responsive Design:** CSS is essential for creating responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes, making them accessible on various devices like smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
* **Customization:** CSS offers a high degree of customization, allowing you to create unique and visually appealing designs.

### Creating a Simple HTML Document with CSS
Let's create a basic HTML document and add a CSS stylesheet to modify its appearance.

**HTML Document (index.html):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CSS Basics</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**CSS Stylesheet (styles.css):**

```css
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 36px;
}

p {
    color: darkblue;
    font-size: 18px;
}
```

### Explanation of the CSS Code
* **`body` selector:** This targets the `<body>` element of the HTML document, which is the container for all the content.
  * **`background-color: lightblue;`:** Sets the background color of the body to light blue.
* **`h1` selector:** This targets all elements with the tag `<h1>`, which represents the main heading.
  * **`color: red;`:** Sets the color of the heading text to red.
  * **`font-size: 36px;`:** Sets the font size of the heading to 36 pixels.
* **`p` selector:** This targets all elements with the tag `<p>`, which represents a paragraph.
  * **`color: darkblue;`:** Sets the color of the paragraph text to dark blue.
  * **`font-size: 18px;`:** Sets the font size of the paragraph to 18 pixels.

By combining these HTML and CSS files, you've created a simple web page with a customized appearance. You can experiment with different CSS properties and values to achieve various styles and effects.
